###HOMEWORK SUBMISSIONS INSTRUCTIONS

Homework will be submitted tracked via git and github issues

First, fork the CSF_Homework repository and clone the forked repository to your local machine, `git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/CSF_Homework.git`

Set the upstream branch back to the main CSF repository,

```
cd CSF_Homework
git remote add upstream https://github.com/generalassembly-studio/CSF_Homework.git
git fetch upstream
```

And then complete the homework assignment! Make sure the commit you use references the Issue # assigned to you for that assignment, and `git commit -am "Finished assignment 1 #12"` and `git push origin master` and go to github and make a pull request to the GA CSF repository.
